**A pure-Rust Thread MeshCoP commissioner.** Commission Thread devices and
manage a network's operational state from Rust — establish the authenticated
DTLS session, petition the border agent, drive management commands and
diagnostics through the mesh, and onboard joiners end to end — with **no
OpenSSL, no mbedTLS, no C toolchain, and zero `unsafe`**.

It implements the non-CCM feature set of the C++
[`ot-commissioner`](https://github.com/openthread/ot-commissioner) reference
(full matrix in [docs/PARITY.md](docs/PARITY.md)), so it is a complete
commissioner rather than a partial reimplementation.

## Why

- **Pure Rust, zero `unsafe`, no C crypto.** Built on small RustCrypto crates
  instead of OpenSSL or mbedTLS, so it cross-compiles cleanly, keeps the
  dependency and attack surface small, and is memory-safe by construction.
- **Async-native.** A Tokio-facing client API; the underlying protocol state
  machines are runtime-neutral and independently testable.
- **Credential-safe by design.** PSKc, network keys, J-PAKE scalars, datasets,
  and derived session keys are redacted in `Debug` and zeroized on drop, and
  `unwrap`/`expect` are lint-forbidden in production code.
- **Held to a high assurance bar.** Deterministic and gated-live tests, coverage
  gates, mutation testing, fuzzing of every wire parser, and supply-chain
  checks — all CI-enforced (see [below](#security-and-quality)).

## What it does

- Establishes the Thread DTLS 1.2 session authenticated with **EC J-PAKE over
  PSKc**, petitions a border agent, and keeps the session alive.
- Reads and writes **active, pending, secure-pending, commissioner, and BBR
  datasets** through a TLV codec that preserves wire order, duplicates, and
  unknown TLVs.
- Routes management commands the way the reference does — commissioner-dataset
  operations, multicast-listener registration, secure pending dissemination,
  **announce / PAN-ID / energy scans**, and **network diagnostics** — through
  the UDP_TX/UDP_RX border-agent proxy with mesh-local ALOC addressing;
  diagnostic answers decode into a typed `NetDiagData` model.
- Commissions **joiners end to end** over the RLY_RX/RLY_TX relay: runs the DTLS
  server side of EC J-PAKE over the joiner PSKd (with HelloVerifyRequest
  cookies), answers JOIN_FIN, and entrusts accepted joiners with the Joiner
  Router KEK.

## Example

```rust
use ot_commissioner_rs::{
    commissioner::{Commissioner, CommissionerConfig, DatasetFlags},
    dataset::Dataset,
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> ot_commissioner_rs::Result<()> {
    // The commissioner authenticates with a PSKc. Derive it from an operational
    // dataset (the usual case — dataset hex is what Thread tooling hands you):
    let dataset_hex = std::env::var("THREAD_DATASET_HEX").expect("dataset hex");
    let dataset = Dataset::from_hex(dataset_hex)?;
    let config = CommissionerConfig::from_dataset("my-commissioner", &dataset)?;
    // ...or pass the 16-byte key straight in:
    //   let config = CommissionerConfig::pskc("my-commissioner", pskc_bytes);

    // Connect to the border agent (host:port) and run the DTLS EC J-PAKE
    // petition to become the active commissioner.
    let border_agent = "192.0.2.1:49191".parse().expect("border agent address");
    let mut commissioner = Commissioner::connect(config, border_agent).await?;
    let petition = commissioner.petition().await?;
    println!("active commissioner, session 0x{:04x}", petition.session_id);

    // Read the live active dataset, then resign cleanly.
    let active = commissioner.get_active_dataset(DatasetFlags::ALL).await?;
    println!("network name: {:?}", active.network_name()?);
    commissioner.resign().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

The [`examples/`](examples) directory has runnable tools built on this API: a
network-diagnostic topology mapper (`netdiag`), read-only live probes, and a
small `commissionerctl`. Examples redact dataset secrets by default and resign
read-only sessions before exiting; mutating operations are gated behind
`OT_COMMISSIONER_MUTATE_OK=1` so routine inspection cannot disturb a live
network.

## Security and Quality

This crate handles sensitive Thread credentials — PSKc, network keys, and full
operational datasets — and is built and tested accordingly. See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat model and the vulnerability-disclosure
process.

- **Pure Rust, no `unsafe`.** `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`; built on small
  RustCrypto crates with no OpenSSL or mbedTLS runtime dependency.
- **Secret hygiene.** PSKc, J-PAKE scalars, datasets, and record-protection keys
  are redacted in `Debug` and zeroized on drop; constant-time primitives
  (`subtle` / RustCrypto) are used where applicable.
- **Tests.** 216 deterministic tests plus gated live border-router tests,
  including in-memory DTLS client-against-server handshakes, an in-process
  loopback DTLS server exercising the Tokio session driver, and a complete
  fake-joiner commissioning flow. Testing policy: no public commissioner
  operation lands without a scripted API test, no wire parser lands without
  malformed-input coverage, and crypto/protocol state machines carry
  negative-path tests, not only happy-path vectors.
- **Live interop (CI-enforced).** Every change commissions a real OpenThread
  border agent (posix `ot-daemon` at a pinned release, driven by a simulated
  RCP) via [interop.yml](.github/workflows/interop.yml): the full DTLS 1.2 +
  EC J-PAKE handshake, petition and keep-alive, a full active-dataset
  comparison, and a UDP-proxied MGMT_COMMISSIONER_GET against the live
  leader. A weekly scheduled run catches drift against OpenThread even when
  this repo is quiet.
- **Coverage gates (CI-enforced).** Minimum 80% line, 80% region, and 75%
  function coverage via `cargo-llvm-cov`.
- **Mutation testing.** `cargo-mutants` runs against the high-risk protocol
  files (EC J-PAKE, DTLS session and server handshake, CoAP, diagnostic and
  notification parsers, the commissioner client, and joiner sessions);
  surviving mutants are triaged and documented as equivalent,
  intrinsic-timeout, or explicitly deferred rather than left silent.
- **Fuzzing.** 13 coverage-guided libFuzzer targets cover every wire parser
  (TLV, dataset, CoAP, DTLS record/handshake/hello, EC J-PAKE key-exchange and
  KKPP, UDP_RX decapsulation, network-diagnostic data, JOIN_FIN), run weekly
  and on demand via [fuzz.yml](.github/workflows/fuzz.yml).
- **Supply chain.** `cargo audit --deny warnings` (advisories) and `cargo deny
  check` (licenses, bans, sources) gate the dependency graph.
- **Reference parity.** Crypto and handshake paths are validated against known
  Thread specification vectors and the OpenThread `ot-commissioner` / mbedTLS
  reference implementations.

Reproduce the core gate locally:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-features
```

## CI Quality Reports

GitHub Actions drives the full quality process from
[quality.yml](.github/workflows/quality.yml):

- `verify` runs `cargo fmt --check`, clippy with `-D warnings`, and
  `cargo test --all-features`.
- `coverage` runs [tools/ci/coverage.sh](tools/ci/coverage.sh), enforces the
  current coverage thresholds, writes a GitHub job summary, and uploads
  `coverage-summary.json`, `lcov.info`, and the HTML report as artifacts.
- `mutants` runs [tools/ci/mutants.sh](tools/ci/mutants.sh), writes a GitHub job
  summary, and uploads `mutants.out` as an artifact.

Mutation testing defaults to the `targeted` scope for the high-risk protocol
files. A manual workflow dispatch can choose `full`, `custom`, or `skip`.
For `custom`, set the repository or organization variable
`CARGO_MUTANTS_FILES` to a space-separated list of file globs.

Generated coverage and mutation reports are CI artifacts, not source files, so
they should not be committed to the repository.

## Limitations and non-goals

In the interest of accuracy (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full threat
model):

- **Not yet independently audited.** The cryptographic and protocol code has not
  had a third-party security audit. Treat it accordingly until that changes.
- **CCM (token/certificate) commissioning is not implemented** and returns
  `Error::Unsupported`. The supported authentication path is EC J-PAKE over
  PSKc.
- **Deferred mutation survivors.** A small number of `cargo-mutants` survivors
  remain in the async DTLS handshake-receive driver; killing them requires an
  in-process DTLS server that emits real handshake flights, which is tracked as
  follow-up work. Remaining survivors elsewhere are documented as equivalent
  mutants.
- **Side-channel scope.** Constant-time primitives are used, but the crate is
  not hardened against power, EM, or microarchitectural side channels.
- **Pre-1.0 API.** Public APIs may change before 1.0.
