//! Pure-Rust Thread MeshCoP commissioner.
//!
//! The crate provides the non-CCM commissioner feature set of the C++
//! `ot-commissioner` reference: dataset TLV codecs, MeshCoP/CoAP message
//! primitives, PSKc helpers, EC J-PAKE/Schnorr NIZK, AES-CCM-8 record
//! protection, and a Tokio-facing commissioner API. A commissioner session
//! can petition a border agent, keep the session alive, read and write
//! operational and commissioner datasets, run scans and network diagnostics
//! through the UDP proxy, and commission joiners end to end over the relay
//! (DTLS server handshake over PSKd, JOIN_FIN, and KEK entrustment).
//! See `docs/PARITY.md` for the feature matrix against the C++ reference.

#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
#![warn(missing_docs)]
// `unwrap`/`expect` are prohibited in production code (allowed in tests via
// `allow-{unwrap,expect}-in-tests` in `clippy.toml`). `cargo clippy -- -D
// warnings` promotes these to hard errors.
#![warn(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used)]

//! # Public API
//!
//! The primary, supported surface is the high-level commissioner:
//! [`commissioner`] (the [`Commissioner`](commissioner::Commissioner) client,
//! its configuration, events, and flags), [`dataset`] (the operational
//! [`Dataset`](dataset::Dataset) and its typed accessors), [`error`], and the
//! network-diagnostic data model in [`meshcop::diag`] (surfaced through
//! commissioner events).
//!
//! The remaining modules — [`crypto`], [`dtls`], [`tlv`], and the CoAP/MeshCoP
//! codecs in [`meshcop`] — are lower-level protocol building blocks. They are
//! exported so the coverage-guided fuzz harnesses can drive the wire parsers
//! directly and so advanced users can build or inspect MeshCoP messages, but
//! they are not the recommended entry point.
